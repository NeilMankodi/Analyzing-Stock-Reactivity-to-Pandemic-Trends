# Analyzing-Stock-Reactivity-to-Pandemic-Trends
Explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the US stock market, employing an end-to-end multifaceted analysis to discern market reactions and trends

The COVID-19 pandemic greatly impacted global markets, prompting an urgent need to understand
market dynamics. Our motivation is to investigate how the market responds to such emergencies and
extract insights which can be used for decision making. For this project, we focus on 4 questions that
revolve around how different parts of the market and the economy reacted to the pandemic and how
we can potentially predict market movement using machine learning methods.
